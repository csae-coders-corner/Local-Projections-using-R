    "Local Projections (Jord√† 2005, AER) are a convenient and flexible way to estimate dynamic, causal effects of a policy of interest several time periods after it comes into effect. Suppose, we have time series data on a variable $y_{t}$ and want to estimate the dynamic causal effects of a policy $\\varepsilon_{t}$ up to $H$ time periods ahead. A convenient, parsimonious way to estimate these effects is using a Local Projection model of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ln(y_{t + h}) = \\alpha^{(h)} + \\beta^{(h)} \\varepsilon_{t} + \\gamma^{(h)} X_{t} + u^{(h)}_{t} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $h = 0,1,2,3,...,H$ and $X_{t}$ are a set of control variables (including potentially lagged values of the dependent variable). The causal effects of interest are summarized by the series of coefficients $\\{ \\beta^{(h)} \\}$. These coefficients are typically visualised through an $\\textit{Impulse Response Function}$ plot which plots the horizon on the x-axis and the coefficient corresponding to the horizon on the y-axis along with confidence intervals. If we are instead interested in the cumulative impulse responses, we can replace $ln(y_{t+h})$ with $ln(y_{t+h}) - ln(y_{t-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Impulse Response Functions are most common in macroeconomic applications using time series data, they are increasingly being used to study the propagation of shocks through time in panel datasets (for a recent example, https://www.nber.org/papers/w31184). This blogpost will provide a brief introduction to estimating and plotting local projection impulse response functions in R."
